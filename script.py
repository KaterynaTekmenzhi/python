## Python Syntax

#1. Using a "print" statement, output a message of your choosing to the terminal.
print ("Hello Kat!")
#2. Python 3 has a parenthesis around the print statement. Python 2 does not. 
print ("Hello Kat!")
#3. Strings can be numbers letters, or symbols.
print ('Hello Kat!')
#4. connect strings together using the + sign.
print ("hi") + "my name is kat"
#5. (Handling errors) mismatched quotes will cause a syntac error. No quotes will cause a name error.
print ("what did you eat for dinner?")
print ('i had salmon')
#6. (Variables) can be used to store strings, numbers, and booleans.
greeting_message = ("welcome kat!")
print (greeting_message)
#7.
